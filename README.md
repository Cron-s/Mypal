First and the foremost goal of this article, is to have a good browser for winxp. And Palemoon is becauase it made for users, but not otherwise.

Mypal handle webpages excactly as the Palemoon,  no differnce there, for now.

But differences are there, in other things like portable modes, removen some bunch of mozilla legacy junk and some settings.

If you not have concern with tech and programing do not bother youselves with patches and other github stuff except issues and wiki.
